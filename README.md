ProII Excel Converter is a little tool that I've created for a friend of me who studies Chemical Engineering.
With this tool you can convert a ProII PLT file with TXY and PXY curves (Temperature and Pressure) to an excel file where that data are ready to be copied or to be used in the same sheet for create a chart.
